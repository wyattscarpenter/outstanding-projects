# outstanding-projects
Projects that I'm meaning to get to that maybe someone else could get to?

If it's unclear what I'm talking about, it's probably one of my GitHub projects, and you can probably search there for additional context. This is all part of the fun.

## maybe you can do these, or at least some of these
- can discord-kill-time be changed to use the CSS route of the similar script somehow, or at least stop crashing discord?
- write rule 124 implementation for FLOWN
- finish austrian-nobleman (the c-as-lisp)
- finish conlang
- possibly, after the conlang is finished, create a language version after that which is radically simpler, as well
- possibly make true ttf (otf? woff?) font for conlang
- figure out if i should make a company or nonprofit or what (tax implications)
- submit question dog to unicode
- finish unsong-book-fetcher 2024 edition
- finish terror-island 2024 edition (also todo: add author names bigger than my own...)
- better note-taming app/system
- misc
- 
- immanentize the eschaton
## probably only I can do these
- write blog posts
- I am in the middle of writing several books, or several parts of one book. general genre "self-help".
- this list itself

## maybe I'll put completed items here in this heading afterwards
